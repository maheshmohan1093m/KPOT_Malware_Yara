**How it infiltrates?**

KPOT is mostly proliferated using fake browser updaters and spam email campaigns. Fake updaters are promoted through deceptive websites that display pop-up messages. These falsely claim that the web browser is outdated and that the user should update it immediately. These pop-ups also contain an "Update" button, which downloads the malicious updater designed to inject KPOT into the system. Spam campaigns, on the other hand, are used to send hundreds of thousands of emails consisting of malicious attachments (typically, Microsoft Office documents or PDF files), and messages encouraging users to open them. Criminals are also likely to present malicious attachments as important documents (e.g., receipts, invoices, etc.). This is done to give the impression of legitimacy and increase the chance of tricking users into opening the files. Trojans are often proliferated using fake software 'cracks', third party software download sources (free file hosting websites, freeware download websites, Peer-to-Peer [P2P] networks, and similar), and other trojans (chain infections).
